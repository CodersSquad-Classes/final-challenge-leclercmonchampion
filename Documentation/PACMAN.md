Graphic Interface :

For the graphical interface we just plan to use the console and create an ASCII graphical interface.
In order to have a better representation of the map and the game for the user, we will use a color system to differentiate the walls, the Pacman, the ghosts and the points.

The Pacman will be represented with the following characters : < (going to the right)    > (going to the left)    v (going up)    ^ (going down) and will be in yellow.

The ghosts will be represented with the following character : n   and will be in different color (not yellow)

The walls will be represented ...
The points will be represented ...
